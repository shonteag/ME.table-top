Document Purpose:
To help the DM become familiar with this piece of software and its use in creating, tracking, and running table-top ME games. Refer to this document for help pertaining to
operation of THIS SOFTWARE SUITE. This manual does not contain help information regarding playing of the actual game.

Creating your game:
1) Create a new game by navigating to the "File" menu and selecting "New Game". Give it a name, and then continue.
2) Navigate to the tree view in the left of the screen and select the game you just created. Click "Load" at the base of the tree view.
   NOTE: Doing so will remove the help screen, and bring you to the "Game Details" screen.
3) Games are made up of missions. So let's add a Mission. Click the "Add Mission" button, give it a name, a level (1-20), and a difficulty (1-4).
4) Now expand the "Missions" item in the tree view, and select the mission you just created. You can edit it's properties here.
   NOTE: YOU MUST SAVE ALL CHANGES TO ANY ITEM YOU EDIT BY CLICKING "Update" IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER!
5) A mission is made up of encounters. Encounters are groups of enemy mobs for the players to battle. Add an encounter by clicking the "Add Encounter" button. Give it a
   name and continue.
6) Now use the treeview to load this new encounter. You will notice, the encounter you just created will have inherited the "level" and "difficulty" of its parent Mission.
   If you want to make a more challenging encounter, or a less challenging encounter, you can toy about with the encounter properties in this window. Don't forget to click
   "Update" (in the upper right corner) when you're done!
7) Encounters consit of enemies (also referred to as 'mobs'). Add an enemy to your encounter by selecting the "Add Enemy" button. Give it a name.
8) Now select the enemy and load it. You can muck about with the settings to create a less or more challenging enemy. You can also roll health, shield, and shield recharge
   based on the stats, level, and difficulty you give that enemy. Careful not to make the encounter too challenging, or players will be frustrated. Frustrated D&D players
   often break tables, throw things, and generally make fools of their wide and kneck-beardy selves.
   DISCLAIMER: Author and distributer of this game not responsible for rampant kneck-beards. DM agrees to assume all risk.
9) Save your game to a file for later use by selecting the "File" from the top menu, and then "Save Game". Give it a file, and click "Save".

To load a game:
1) Navigate to the "File" menu, select "Load Game", and select the file you used to save the desired game. Click "Open".

A Note About Saving:
When you save and then load a game, if you were in combat when the game was saved, all enemies will be reset to max health and shields. Do not "quit" play during combat.
